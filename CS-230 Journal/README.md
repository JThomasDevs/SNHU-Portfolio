# 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission

The client was _The Gaming Room_, and they wanted me to design a web-based version of their game, _Draw It or Lose It_, a game in which images are slowly rendered on the screen and teams compete to most quickly guess what is being drawn.

In the documentation, I believe I did particularly well in developing the UML diagram for the basic game logic. The diagram is neatly organized and the arrows between classes clearly demonstrate which classes relate to each other and how.

Often when writing code, it is easy to get lost between the lines. Having a design document helped keep me on task and remind me of the big picture. I was able to refer back to the design document when I was unsure of how to proceed with the code.

I don't believe I would revise any part of the design document other than generally correcting grammar or replacing words with more precise synonyms. 

My interpretation of the primary concern regarding the user's needs was that the game, as a multiplayer web-based application, MUST be low latency. If the game is too slow, it will simply not be worth playing. It is important to consider the needs of the end user because they are the ones who ultimately determine the value of the product. If the product does not meet the needs of the user, it will fail.

In designing the software, I began at the UML diagram. From there, I began working with the code, one class at a time. Without the UML diagram, it would be easy to forget how one class is supposed to relate to the others or how the entire program is supposed to function. The UML diagram is a great way to keep track of the big picture.
