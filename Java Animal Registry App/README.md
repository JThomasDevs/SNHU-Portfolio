# Service Animal Registry

A practice in making an application in Java with multiple classes and class inheritance, this program simulates a service animal registry system in which users may:

- Register a new service animal
- Reserve either a dog or monkey given that one is available
- Print lists of all dogs, all monkeys, or all non-reserved animals
