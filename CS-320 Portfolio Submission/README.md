- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional by performing extensive tests across automatic and manual methodologies that are defined and designed around client specifications paired with my knowledge as a professional software engineer.

I can maintain security within my code by being aware of and mitigating for common security vulnerabilities that may arise from specific code patterns and by keeping up to date on more recent exploits for which to account.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To properly interpret user needs, I will need to be able to "translate" the user's stated desires into concrete, implementable features. For instance, if a user states that a page lacks synergy, I can interpret this as meaning that the elements within the page do not fit together in a manner that feels coherent and thus, the visual or functional flow of the page should be adjusted to ease the user experience.

- How do I approach designing software?

In a professional environment, I approach software design from a requirements-oriented standpoint. When software is designed around the client's stated requirements, a development team is able to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP). If this MVP does not meet client expectations, further requirements and feature lists are able to be gathered more easily based on what has been delivered and what features/capabilities are still desired by the client. In this cycle, a fully functional product is delivered as the final result while still enabling the addition of further functionality and enabling a potentially non-technical client to refine their stated desires based on differences between the product and their vision.
