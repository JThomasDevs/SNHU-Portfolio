I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following a specific set of self-imposed guidelines as I work.

- First, do not fall into the trap of thinking that because I wrote the code, I will remember exactly how it works when I look at it later.

- Especially for code with more complex functionality, make extensive use of comments to explain what is happening in the code and why.

- Use descriptive variable and function names whenever possible. In other words, a variable should describe the data that it holds and a function should describe its primary use-case. 

- Avoid abbreviation whenever possible.

- When building a full stack application, use the Model-View-Controller framework to create a separation of concerns and enable re-usability and easy re-iteration of any individual component.

Working in accordance with these guidelines both ensures that expanding functionality of any component of the project is relatively straightforward and that new readers of the code can easily understand the implementation.

Additionally, using the MVC framework allows the CRUD module to be re-used in other projects. One such project could be a program for the Austin Animal Shelter's intake/outtake system to aid in maintaining records of animals under the care of the facility.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems from a data-oriented perspective. At its core, computer science is moving and manipulating data. In practice, this means that when starting a solution, I examine the data that is either provided or determine what data needs to be gathered. After starting data is obtained and its structure known, I construct a plan for how this data is to be manipulated, filtered, and consumed to obtain my desired results.

In the modern age, computer scientists do the work that makes modern life possible. From massively powerful desktop computers hosting advanced software, to GPS enabled avalanche beacons, to hospital-wide RFID enabled tracking bracelets, computer science has touched nearly every aspect of modern living.
