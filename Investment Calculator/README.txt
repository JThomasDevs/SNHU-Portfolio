This project was created for my CS-210 course (C++) while attending SNHU.

The project is a simple calculator which takes input for an initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, annual interest percentage, and number of years.

Given these values, the program will calculate yearly balances and yearly interest accrued for every year of the input value.
The interest is calculated as monthly compounding interest.

After calculation, two tables are printed:
One that displays calculated values if the user should choose not to make monthly deposits
Another that displays calculated values if the user should choose to make monthly deposits

###
The only modification made to this program post-submission is the addition of 'system("pause")' so that when using the executable, the program pauses until the user hits a key so that they may view the value tables.
