# DriverPass Project Two

Throughout this course, I had been tasked with helping develop a cloud-based system for a company named DriverPass. The goal of this system was to aid users in preparing for their driver's license exam by providing them with practice tests and driving lessons.

My primary role in this development was analyzing client requirements and designing the system from the ground up.

In the designing of this system, one thing I did particularly well was the completion of the Business Requirements Document for Project One. This document was a detailed breakdown of the system's requirements, objectives, background, and much other information relevant to the requirements and design of this system.

If I were to choose one thing about my work on the final project to revise, I would be more thorough in describing the technical requirements for the system including discussing the hardware needed for the system to function.

I interpreted the user's needs based on the client's stated desires for user capabilities and translated each of these desired capabilities to use-cases that each represent one action that the user can take when accessing the system.

For the final project, I was asked to take a UML Use Case Diagram for the DriverPass system created for an earlier assignment and from it, produce UML Activity Diagrams for two of the use cases, a sequence diagram for one of those use cases, and a class diagram describing possible classes that may be used in the system. Additionally, I was tasked with listing several technical requirements of the system that would be present based on the diagrams I had created.

I was also tasked with creating a presentation breaking down the details of the system which featured speaker notes focused on presenting the system to a non-technical audience. This was an exercise in translating technical requirements and features to non-technical language so that the average person would be able to understand how the DriverPass system functions.
