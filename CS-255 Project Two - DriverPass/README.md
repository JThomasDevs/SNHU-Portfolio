# DriverPass Project Two

Throughout this course, I had been tasked with helping develop a cloud-based system for a company named DriverPass.

My primary role in this development was analyzing client requirements and designing the system from the ground up.

For the final project, I was asked to take a UML Use Case Diagram for the DriverPass system created for an earlier assignment and from it, produce UML Activity Diagrams for two of the use cases, a sequence diagram for one of those use cases, and a class diagram describing possible classes that may be used in the system. Additionally, I was tasked with listing several technical requirements of the system that would be present based on the diagrams I had created.

I was also tasked with creating a presentation breaking down the details of the system which featured speaker notes focused on presenting the system to a non-technical audience. This was an exercise in translating technical requirements and features to non-technical language so that the average person would be able to understand how the DriverPass system functions.
