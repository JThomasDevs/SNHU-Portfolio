# SNHU Portfolio

A small collection of code and executables from university projects and assignments. 

Any university-related code that I want for archival purposes will be placed in this repository.

If my professor is reading this, feel free to take a look around at my other projects. If you have any feedback, I'd be happy to hear it.
