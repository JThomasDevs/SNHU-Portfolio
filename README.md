# SNHU Portfolio

A small collection of code and executables from university projects and assignments. 

Any university-related code that I want for archival purposes will be placed in this repository.

Projects will be named with a basic, descriptive name and the project's language.
All projects will have their own README files that further discuss the nature and origin of the project.

If my professor is reading this, feel free to take a look around at my other projects. If you have any feedback, I'd be happy to hear it.
