# CPP-Demo-Code
A small collection of C++ code and executables from university projects and assignments. 
This repository has been created under the instruction of my professor so that he may be added to this repo as a collaborator.

More code may be added here in the future but I will likely make future projects their own repository.

If my professor is reading this, feel free to take a look around at my other projects. If you have any feedback, I'd be happy to hear it.
