# README

In this project, I was given two Python files, one to define the Maze game and its methods and the other to define the experience replay class and its methods. Beyond this, most of the code in the Jupyter notebook was provided as starter code, including the function to build the model.

My addition to the code was the q_train() function in the Jupyter notebook. This function defines the training method for the provided model and uses deep Q learning to train the model.
