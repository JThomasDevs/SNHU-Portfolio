# CS-250 Final Project

Throughout this course, I was tasked with emulating every role of a Scrum-agile team.

The final project for the course was a Sprint Retrospective in which I reflect on my work emulating different Scrum-agile team members and the importance each team member has in the development process.

Additionally, I was tasked with creating a presentation reflecting on my understanding of the SDLC, the Scrum-agile process, and the benefits/drawbacks that this approach has as compared to the Waterfall approach.
