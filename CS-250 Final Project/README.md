# CS-250 Final Project

## 8-2 Journal

I can interpret user needs and implement them into a program by:
- listening to client requirements for user experiences
- asking clarifying questions about how specific UI features should be implemented
- constantly adapting to user feedback
- conferring with my team (if I am part of one) regarding user feedback about how to best implement proper solutions

As a primarily solo developer, my approach to developing programs begins with a big-picture idea like "I want to build a website," followed by a rough draft mental image of how I want my finished product to look and behave. After this, I usually dive straight into writing code, adjusting it as the application grows and unplanned requirements appear. If I incorporated any agile practice into my future development work, I would spend more time collecting and analyzing requirements. I would also spend more time creating a design for how I want my application to look and behave before writing any code.

Being a good team member in software development means fully dedicating yourself to the team and providing the best effort you can to further progress the project. This comes in many forms:
- open communication with other team members
- completing one's work within given timeframes or notifying the team when this is not possible for any reason
- providing insight on subjects that are specific to one's role within the team

Throughout this course, I was tasked with emulating every role of a Scrum-agile team.

The final project for the course was a Sprint Retrospective in which I reflected on my work emulating different Scrum-agile team members and the importance each team member has in the development process.

Additionally, I was tasked with creating a presentation reflecting on my understanding of the SDLC, the Scrum-agile process, and the benefits/drawbacks of this approach compared to the Waterfall approach.
