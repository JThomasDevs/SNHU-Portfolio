### OSHA-n Justice

This is a simple, text-based game written in Python made for my university coursework.

The goal of the game is to navigate the Factory, finding OSHA violations along the way.
After finding all violations, the player must confront the Factory Owner in the Office to win.
Confronting the Factory Owner without finding all violations will result in a loss.

The only addition post-submission was the colorama package.
Colorama is the only dependency and that's just for the fun colors in the text.
The game is fully functional without it.
